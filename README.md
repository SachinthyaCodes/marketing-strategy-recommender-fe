```

## Backend Integration

The frontend is configured to work with a FastAPI backend running on `http://localhost:8000`. 

### API Endpoint Expected

```typescript
POST /api/strategy-recommendations
Content-Type: application/json

{
  businessProfile: { ... },
  budgetResources: { ... },
  businessGoals: { ... },
  targetAudience: { ... },
  platformsPreferences: { ... },
  currentChallenges: { ... },
  strengthsOpportunities: { ... },
  marketSituation: { ... }
}
```

### Backend Setup

Make sure your Python FastAPI backend:
1. Accepts the above JSON structure
2. Runs on port 8000
3. Has CORS configured to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`
4. Returns marketing strategy recommendations

Example FastAPI CORS configuration:
```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## Form Data Structure

The application collects data in a structured format that includes:

### Business Profile
- Business type/industry
- Business size (solo, small team, medium, large)
- Business stage (new, growing, established)
- Location details
- Products/services description
- Unique selling proposition

### Marketing Budget & Resources
- Monthly marketing budget ranges
- Team structure (solo vs team)
- Content creation capabilities

### Business Goals
- Primary marketing goals (brand awareness, leads, sales, etc.)
- Secondary objectives

### Target Audience
- Demographics (age, gender, income)
- Geographic location
- Interests and behaviors
- Buying frequency patterns

### Platform Preferences
- Preferred social media platforms
- Experience level on each platform
- Brand assets (logo, style guide, colors)

### Challenges & Opportunities
- Current marketing challenges
- Business strengths
- Growth opportunities

### Market Situation
- Seasonality factors
- Competitor behavior
- Stock availability
- Recent pricing changes

## Customization

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme. You can modify the colors in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
colors: {
  primary: { /* Blue color palette */ },
  secondary: { /* Gray color palette */ },
  success: { /* Green color palette */ },
  warning: { /* Yellow/Orange color palette */ }
}
```

### Adding New Form Sections
1. Create a new step component in `src/components/steps/`
2. Add the step configuration to the `STEPS` array in `src/app/page.tsx`
3. Add the corresponding type definitions in `src/types/index.ts`
4. Update the switch statement in the main page component

### Form Validation
Form validation is handled by React Hook Form. Each step component includes required field validation and custom validation rules as needed.

## Development

### Code Structure
- Components use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Form state is managed using React Hook Form
- Each step component is self-contained and reusable
- Data flows up to the main page component through callback props

### State Management
- Form data is managed at the page level
- Each step receives current data and an update callback
- Data persists as users navigate between steps
- Form submission is handled centrally
